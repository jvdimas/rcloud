rcloud aims to provide a package for R programmers to access PiCloud's computational resources easily from within R to more quickly solve CPU bound problems.

Its goals are similar to segue with the fundmanetal difference that it is built on PiCloud instead of AWS directly. I hope that this will have the following advantages:

- Fractional billing rounded to the nearest millisecond. (PiCloud does charge more so very large computations it is likely to be more exensive).
- No need to wait for EMR instances to become ready after booting and bootstrapping
- Leverge web interface already built by PiCloud
- Host computer is not a single point of failure -- computational results stored by PiCloud. Can start a job and shutdown your computer while the result is computed
